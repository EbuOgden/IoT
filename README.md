<b>Assignments' Purpose</b>

- Assignment 1: Showing Random Sensor Data on a Table in HTML Web Page.

- Assignment 2: Showing Random Sensor Data on a Table in HTML Web Page which is created by a Python Script.

- Assignment 3: Showing Random Sensor Data on a Table in HTML Web Page by Serving from Raspberry PI. (I used Node.js on Raspberry PI)

- Assignment 4: Showing Random Sensor Data on a Table in HTML Web Page, Which is Created by a Python Script, by Serving from Raspberry PI. (I used Node.js on Raspberry PI)

- Assignment 5: Turning On and Off a Red Led Light. Creating a Loop to Change Colors With Another Led Light on Raspberry PI.

- Assignment 6: Turning On and Off a Red Led Light by from Web Client by a Web Server on Raspberry PI. (I used Node.js)

- Assignment 7: Writing your own name on a LCD Screen which is connected to Raspberry PI.

- Assignment 8: Showing Real Time Temperature and Barometric Pressure Data, which is taken by BMP280 Module, on a Graph in Web Client by Serving from Raspberry PI. (I Used Node.js, SocketIO to Server the Real Time Data. Also I Created a Bridge Between Node JS and BPM280 Python Script to Get and Use the Output Data From the Sensor in Node JS.)

- Assignment 9: Showing Real Time Temperature and Barometric Pressure Data, which is taken by BMP280 Module, on Raspberry PI by Using PubNup.

- Assignment 9#1: Inserting Real Time Temperature and Barometric Pressure Data, which is taken by BMP280 Module, to NoSQL Database, Getting and Showing on a Graph in Web Client with Time Axis by Serving from Raspberry PI. (I Used Cassandra as a NoSQL Database)
